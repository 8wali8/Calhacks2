# Analytics Integration - Updates

## Recent Changes

### 1. Auto-Stop on Call End ✅
Analytics now automatically stop when you leave the Tavus call. The system listens for the `disconnected` event from the TavusInterview component and cleanly stops all analytics processing.

**Implementation:**
- [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx): Updated event handler to set `isInterviewRunning = false` on `disconnected` event
- [components/AnalyticsPanel.tsx](components/AnalyticsPanel.tsx): Modified stop logic to only stop if analytics were actually running

### 2. Summary Statistics After Interview ✅
When the interview ends, a summary panel automatically appears showing the mean (average) of the top 3 metrics:

- **Avg Speech Rate** - Words per minute (measures talking speed)
- **Avg Fillers** - Filler words per minute (um, uh, like, etc.)
- **Gaze Stability** - Eye movement metric (lower = more stable/focused)

**Implementation:**
- Uses `controller.getMetricsSummary()` from analytics controller
- Displays in a clean 3-column grid below the live metrics
- Shows "● Completed" status indicator

### 3. Live Metrics During Interview
During the interview, the following real-time metrics are displayed:

- **WPM** - Words per minute (color-coded: green=good, yellow=ok, red=needs work)
- **Pitch** - Voice pitch in Hz
- **Pause** - Pause ratio percentage (natural pauses are good)
- **Fillers** - Filler words per minute (lower is better)
- **Blink** - Blinks per minute (tracks eye movement)
- **Gaze Stability** - Eye position variance (lower = more focused)
- **Emotion** - Detected emotions from speech (joy, neutral, etc.)

All metrics are color-coded based on quality thresholds.

## Metrics Explained

### Speech Metrics
- **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Ideal range is 120-180 WPM for interviews
- **Fillers**: Um, uh, like, you know, etc. - ideally < 5 per minute
- **Pitch**: Voice frequency in Hz - typically 75-400 Hz
- **Pause Ratio**: Percentage of time pausing - 15-25% is natural

### Visual Metrics
- **Blink Rate**: Normal is 15-20 blinks/min - too few or many can indicate stress
- **Gaze Stability**: Measures eye movement consistency
  - < 2000: Very stable (looking steadily at camera)
  - 2000-10000: Normal (reading, natural scanning)
  - > 10000: High movement (looking around, distracted)

### Emotion Analysis
Uses GoEmotions model (28 emotions) to classify sentiment from speech transcripts. Shows top 3 emotions with confidence scores.

## How It Works

```
User starts Tavus interview
    ↓
Event: 'connected' fires
    ↓
Analytics auto-start
    ↓
    - Request camera/mic
    - Spawn TensorFlow.js face worker
    - Start audio worklet for pitch
    - Start speech recognition (ASR)
    - Publish metrics every 100ms (10 Hz)
    ↓
Live badges update in real-time
    ↓
User leaves call
    ↓
Event: 'disconnected' fires
    ↓
Analytics auto-stop
    ↓
Summary statistics displayed
```

## Files Modified

### Core Integration
- `app/page.tsx` - Added interview state tracking and disconnected event handling
- `components/AnalyticsPanel.tsx` - Added summary stats display and improved stop logic

### No Changes Required
- All analytics library files work as-is
- LiveBadges component already shows all metrics
- No refactoring of analytics logic needed

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Analytics start when interview connects
- [x] Live metrics display during interview
- [x] Analytics stop when leaving call
- [x] Summary statistics appear after stopping
- [x] Gaze stability metric shown in summary
- [x] Speech rate labeled clearly
- [x] All 7 live metrics display correctly

## Summary Panel Format

```
Session Summary (Top 3 Metrics)
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Avg Speech Rate │  Avg Fillers    │ Gaze Stability  │
│      145        │        3        │      1250       │
│   words/min     │   per minute    │ lower is better │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

All metrics from the session are also logged to console for debugging purposes.
